Gig Blaster
===========
I wrote this plugin to learn about how WP plugins work but also to simplify adding gigs to my website. I happily used [Really Simple Events](https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-events) for years, and this plugin is very much inspired by that, but takes it a couple steps further to make my workflow EVEN EASIER.

Usage
-----
After activation a database table called [wp-prefix]-gigblaster will be added. Use the "Gigs" admin interface to add/remove/update gigs.

Use the shortcode `[gigblaster]` to display upcoming gigs wherever you like.

Todo
----
- add default date when adding a new gig
- make upcoming / past views sticky and remove or gray out other link
- add JS timepicker
- add default CSS
